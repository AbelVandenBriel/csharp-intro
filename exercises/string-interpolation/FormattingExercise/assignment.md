# Assignment

Write a class `Formatter` with the following members:

* `Greet(string name)` that returns the string `"Hello, name"` where `name` is replaced
  by the given name.
* `FormatDate(int day, int month, int year)` that produces the string `"day/month/year"`.
  The day and month part must be exactly two wide, using `0` as padding. For example,
  `FormatDate(1, 1, 1)` should return `01/01/1`. Note: this functionality is built-in,
  so look online for how to do it.
